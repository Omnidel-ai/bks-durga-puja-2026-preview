## Do not use these as the review URL

| URL | Why not |
| --- | --- |
| `https://asitsarkar-crypto.github.io/bks-durga-puja-2026-preview/` | First Pages attempt on a personal GitHub account. **Superseded.** Use the OmniDel.ai URL above. |
| `https://bks-durga-puja-2026-preview.vercel.app/` | Isolated Vercel project exists, but the published alias is an **incomplete stub**. Vercel SSO also walls preview deploys. **Do not send Ram Sir here.** |
| `https://bks-brand-system-demo.vercel.app` | Existing BKS Brand System demo. **Not touched.** |
| Chapter / production domains | **Not touched.** |
| OmniDel production GitHub repos | **Not touched.** This preview is a separate repo. |

## How to review

1. Open the GitHub Pages URL above.
2. Read the top banner: **PROTOTYPE — REVIEW DRAFT**.
3. Walk Home → The Puja → Programme → Community → Krishak Samaj → Participate.
4. Footer: Accessibility, Sustainability, Contact.
5. Switch **EN / বাং**.
6. On a phone, use **Menu**.
7. Treat every EMPTY / PLACEHOLDER / PENDING / PROPOSED / TBA label as still open. Do not read them as confirmed facts.

Local copy (same architecture): `python -m http.server 8765` then http://localhost:8765/prototype/

## Review checklist (Ram Sir)

Use these eleven items. None of them is closed by this preview.

1. **Overall visual direction** — forest green, cream, gold; seasonal gathering, not a second brand.
2. **BKS branding** — canonical seal in the header; no festival lockup; wordmark Bharatiya Krishak Samaj.
3. **Hero** — H1 is the default of three **PROPOSED** variants (H1 / H2 / H3). Replaceable.
4. **Puja positioning** — culture first; the Samaj sits with the Puja and does not replace it.
5. **Krishak Samaj relationship** — bounded page; not the home secondary CTA.
6. **Bengali** — full bilingual shell. Copy is **DRAFT — NATIVE EDIT REQUIRED**.
7. **Programme** — civic West Bengal holidays only, labelled CIVIC / pending panjika / TBA. Named BKS programme remains EMPTY.
8. **Community** — eight story wells, all EMPTY. No invented people.
9. **Participation** — visit / volunteer / support pathways. No forms. No payment. “Not collecting money.”
10. **Accessibility** — digital pattern present. Physical venue access is **not** claimed.
11. **Mobile experience** — 375 Menu + language toggle; no horizontal overflow in the live check.

## Known limitations

- GitHub Pages host is a **public** repository under **Omnidel-ai** so Ram Sir can open it without a GitHub login. Search indexing is blocked (`robots.txt` + `noindex`). Do not submit the URL to search consoles.
- Optional Google Fonts (`Baloo Da 2`, `Hind Siliguri`, `display=optional`) may not always transfer; the system stack still renders.
- Unused local seal/logo files (`bks-seal.png`, `bks-logo.png`) were **not** uploaded.
- Research notes, checkpoints, Purulia / Vatika / Biophilic / OmniSocial / Supabase files were **not** uploaded.
- Vercel CLI was not usable (hang). An isolated Vercel project named `bks-durga-puja-2026-preview` was created so nothing existing would be overwritten, then **abandoned as the review host** because MCP file deploy could not carry the full prototype and SSO blocked public preview URLs.
- Live Lighthouse was **not** re-run on GitHub Pages. Local lab scores (14 Aug 2026, localhost) are recorded below. Do not treat them as live scores.

## Production safety

Verified authenticated Vercel team: ram badrinathan’s projects. Existing projects including `bks-brand-system-demo`, `bks-west-bengal`, chapter sites, Vatika, Biophilic, and Omni* were **not** deployed to.

This preview is GitHub Pages on a **new isolated repo** in the OmniDel.ai org: `Omnidel-ai/bks-durga-puja-2026-preview`. OmniDel production repositories were not modified.

**No production system was modified.**
